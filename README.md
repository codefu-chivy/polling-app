# Full Stack Voting Application

This application allows users to vote on existing polls and authenticated users to create and manage their own polls. Other features include a chart created with Chart.js that gives a visual representation of votes, and a comment section. Currently any user may create a comment, but only authenticated users can like or dislike comments. Authentication is handled with React Stormpath. Live page: https://pollers-app.herokuapp.com
